# MSUpdateAPI

MSUpdateAPI is a REST API designed to allow easy programmatic access to Windows Update Services without either:
* Running an entire on-prem WSUS implementation for the UpdateServices Powershell module to function
* Parsing HTML from the Microsoft Update Catalog and all of the pitfalls inherent with that approach

This is accomplished by directly connecting to the Windows Update Services SOAP endpoints, downloading the needed metadata, parsing, and storing it locally for quick access with minimal storage requirements.

The application consists of two main components which are designed to run directly in Azure Apps and Azure Functions with metadata being stored in Cosmos DB. These are: 
* UpdateProcessor - An Azure Function which handles reading, parsing, and inserting update metadata into the database.
* UpdateAPI - An Azure App REST API to provide access to the parsed metadata generated by the UpdateProcessor Azure Function.

The implementation of the WSUSSS protocol is taken from the [update-server-server-sync](https://github.com/microsoft/update-server-server-sync) repository, but has been heavily modified to add additional needed features and to add async functionality.

## Configuration

### Database

Both the API and the metadata processor require access to a Cosmos DB account for storing the parsed metadata. This is configured with the following environment variables:

```
DatabaseConfiguration__Uri = <the URI of your Cosmos DB endpoint>
DatabaseConfiguration__PrimaryKey = <Cosmos DB access key>
DatabaseConfiguration__DatabaseName = <the name of the database to be used in Cosmos DB>
```

Note that the API component only requires read access to the database, so a read only key should be used. Additionally, the metadata processor will automatically create the database with a manual throughput limit of 1000RU/s at the database level. As such you should not attempt to create the database yourself inside of Cosmos DB.

If running locally, you can use the Cosmos DB emulator and place the above configuration details in the `appsettings.json` and `local.settings.json` files for the API and metadata processor respectively.

### Update Categories and Products

Windows Update Services contain an enormous amount of updates, many of which are not likely to be needed for your particular use case. By limiting the types of updates and the products for which they apply, the time and storage needed for metadata download can be significantly reduced.

The metadata processor requries at least one update classification and one product to be defined. This is configured with the following environment variables:

```
Configuration__EnabledCategories__[0] = <the GUID of an update category>
Configuration__EnabledProducts__[0] = <the GUID of a product category>
Configuration__EnabledProducts__[1] = <the GUID of a product category>
```

## Usage

### Status

Easily check the state of the application

#### Request
`GET /api`

#### Response

```json

  "state": "Loading Metadata",
  "categoryCount": 10,
  "productCount": 400,
  "updateCount": 801,

    "Loading update metadata: 150/1246",
    "Loading update metadata: 149/1246",
    "Loading update metadata: 148/1246",
    "Loading update metadata: 147/1246",
    "Loading update metadata: 146/1246",
    "Loading update metadata: 145/1246",
    "Loading update metadata: 144/1246",

    "Loading update metadata: 142/1246",
    "Loading update metadata: 141/1246"
  ]
}
```

### Categories

Lists the update categories enabled, or optionally all categories in the database

#### Request

`GET /api/category`

#### Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": "0fa1201d-4330-4fa8-8ae9-b877473b6441",
    "name": "Security Updates"
  }
]
```

#### Optional Parameters

|--------------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ShowDisabled | bool | Request will return all categories in the database, instead of just those that are enabled |

##### Example
